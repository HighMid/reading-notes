## Class 14 Notes

### Psychological Safefy

1. **What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**

    - Interpersonal Trust and Mutual Respect: Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other.
    - Openness and the Ability to Speak Up: An environment where individuals feel they can voice their opinions and ideas without fear of punishment or humiliation.
    - Diversity and Inclusiveness: A setting where diverse perspectives are valued and contribute to the team's success.

2. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

    > Won't go into details but an event I had in the military essentially made me realize that my supervisors who were suppose to help guide the Junior enlisted were both ego tripping losers. The environment was pretty hostile and you already know it's bad when they start to introduce mandatory fun.  Voiced concerned were glossed over and most of those people(included myself) got isolated for job upgrades, potential TDYs etc.

3. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

    - Teams with high psychological safety are typically more productive, innovative, and collaborative.  

    - They contribute positively to the company by driving performance and employee engagement.

    - Team members in such environments are likely to have higher job satisfaction, contribute more freely, and have a stronger commitment to the team and company goals.
