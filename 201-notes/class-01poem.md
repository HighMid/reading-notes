## Class 01 "Poem"

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
How data moves from town to town,
It's HTTP, the protocol in action,
Sending info with lightning-fast traction.

(Chorus)
HTTP, it's the way to communicate,
Between computers, it's how we operate,
With requests and responses, it's the key,
To surf the web and set our data free.

(Verse 2)
We got a client, and we got a server,
They connect through HTTP, no need to swerve,
The client says, "Hey, I need some data, please,"
Sends a request, it's like a digital tease.

(Chorus)
HTTP, it's the way to communicate,
Between computers, it's how we operate,
With requests and responses, it's the key,
To surf the web and set our data free.

(Verse 3)
The server gets the request, it ain't no joke,
Processes it quick, sends back a response, no cloak,
With a status code, like 200 for success,
Or 404 when the page is a mess.

(Chorus)
HTTP, it's the way to communicate,
Between computers, it's how we operate,
With requests and responses, it's the key,
To surf the web and set our data free.

(Verse 4)
Headers and body, they carry the load,
In the HTTP message, that's how it's told,
HTML, CSS, or some JSON flair,
HTTP delivers, no matter what's in the air.

(Chorus)
HTTP, it's the way to communicate,
Between computers, it's how we operate,
With requests and responses, it's the key,
To surf the web and set our data free.

(Outro)
So next time you browse, remember the rhyme,
HTTP's the reason it all works on time,
From server to client, it's the internet's glue,
Sending data worldwide, yeah, it's what we do!
