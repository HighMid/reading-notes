## Class 14 Notes

### Diversity and Inclusion

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    > The decline of women in computer science in the 1980s coincided with the rise of personal computers. These early home computers were often marketed primarily to boys, framing computer technology as a male-oriented activity. This period saw a cultural shift where computing started being associated more with men than women, which differed from earlier decades when women were more visibly involved in the field.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    >The fact that males had been playing with computers growing up is significant because it gave them a familiarity and comfort with these technologies that many females did not have. As personal computers were marketed and perceived as "boys' toys," boys had more opportunities to interact with and learn about computers at home. This early exposure likely contributed to a greater interest and proficiency in computer science among males, which further influenced the gender dynamics in education and the industry.

3. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    >- Diversity efforts are most successful when they're embedded within the culture of an organization and are supported by senior leadership. These efforts should be intentional, actionable, and measurable, focusing on creating an environment of equity and inclusion

    >- An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is in product design, where products are developed considering various cultural, linguistic, and accessibility needs. This approach ensures that products are accessible and appealing to a wide range of people, reflecting the diversity of the general population

4. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    >Diverse companies often perform better because they bring a variety of perspectives, experiences, and skills to the table. This diversity in thought and background can lead to more creative problem-solving and innovation. It can also help in understanding and catering to a broader range of customers or clients, as the company workforce more closely mirrors the diversity of the general population.

5. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    >An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is seen in product design and marketing. For instance, a tech company with a diverse team is more likely to be aware of and cater to the needs of different demographic groups, ensuring their products are accessible and appealing to a wide range of people. This could manifest in user interface design, marketing strategies, or customer service approaches that are more inclusive and considerate of various cultural, linguistic, and accessibility needs.
