## Class-02 Notes

### What is a command line?
- It's a text base interface to the system. The line prompts the user for input and issues the command.

### 4 Important features to look for in a text editor:
1. Code completion
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Variety of themes/customization
4. Extentions

### Common Commands in Terminal
1. pwd - **Print Working Directory** (Shows path of working directory from root)
2. ls - **List** (Lists information about directories and any type of files)
3. cd - **Change Directory** (Change current directory of the terminal)
4. mkdir - **Make Directory** (Able to set permission, create multiple directories)
5. touch - **Touch** (Create new files from the terminal)

### Example Scenarios
1. **cd projects** - Changes your directory to the projects folder if there is one
2. **mkdir new-project** - Creates a new directory called "new-projects"
3. **touch new-proejct/newfile.md** - Creates an empty file named "newfile.md" inside the directory
4. **cd ..** - Go up one level from current directory
5. **ls projects/new-project** - Lists the contents of "new-project" inside the "projects" directory
