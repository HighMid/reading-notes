### Expressions in Javascript

### Loop usage

- Loops are used in many things such as input validation, interactive sequences and calculations. Examples are data collection, automation and certain operations that require multiple operations to achieve the goal.

- **for** loops are considered pre-test *(Tests the condition before executed)* loops that are commonly used when the user knows how many iterations is needed(Count-Controlled loops). These loops stop executing when the specific number of iteration has been achieved in a form of a conditional statement.

- **while** loops executes until the condition is evaluated to **false** . This means as long as the statements are considered **true** it'll keep executing the loop until otherwise.
