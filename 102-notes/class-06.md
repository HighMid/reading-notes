## Class 06 Notes

### Variables in Javascript

- Variables are locations in the memory that store data which can be used later by the user or the program. These variables can be seperated into 3 data types.

1. **Strings** - anything encased in '__' .
2. **Numbers** - integers/floats
3. **Boolean** - True/False

### Declaring Variables

- Declaring a variable sets a location that is able to store whatever data you wish to store. This makes it become usable in the program if data needs to be passed or stored.

### Assignment Operators

- Assignment operators are ways to assign a value to a variable with the most common one being '=' . Here are a few more assignment operators.

1. **+=** - Adds the value on the right to the variable and assigns it back, (*Like x = x + 2 but written as x += 2*)
2. **-=** - Subtracts the value on the right from the variable and assigns it back (*Like x = x - 2 but written as x -= 2*)
3. **\*=** - Multiples the value on the right by the variable on the left and assigns the value back (*Like x = x \* 2 but written as  x \*= 2*)

### User Input

- User input is what any information receieved from the user is called. These tend to come in the form of a box requiring information from the user.  Could also just be a button that a user needs to press depending on how the programmer wanted the information to be obtained.
