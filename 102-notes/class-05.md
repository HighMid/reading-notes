### What is CSS?

- CSS is one of the spouses of markup languages(like HTML) that allows the user to make their page look presentable.  Imagine a mannequin, HTML is the figure while CSS is the clothes on the figure. CSS presents the structure that was made using HTML into a form that is digestable to your target audience.
