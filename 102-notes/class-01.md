## Class 01 Notes

**What is Markdown?**

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.  This reminds me of pseudocode in that the syntax isn't strict and you are able to choose options to display certain elements.

**Why use Markdown?**

- Markdown is extremely versatile in that it can be utilized for everything.
- Portable so you don't have to tailor text to a specific design when transitioning to something different. Because of this, it is future proof as you'll be able to use Markdown text with potentially new documentation.
- Discord uses it so it's pretty convenient.
