## Class 07 Notes

### Control Flow

- Is the order in which the computer executes the statements in scripts.  Code is ran from the first line to the last line in a file, these can change depending on certain structures such as conditional statements and loops.  This means that even though you read code from top to bottom there might be additional instructions that require you to take a different path depending on different conditions or inputs.

### JavaScript Functions()

- Functions are blocks of code that execute when it is called/invoked when running a program.  These can hold additional instructions that can be conveniently reused without adding the same lines of code in a program. These can be used to prompt user's for information and when the function is completed they can return the value back to main.

- The parenthesis( ) in a function are used to declare the parameters.  These do not always have to be filled in just like how these functions do not need to return a value if it's not needed.  The parameters are used to pass information to the function.
