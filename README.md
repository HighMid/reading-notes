## Growth Mindset (Lab 01b) &#x1F4AA;

**A growth mindset to me is being able to commit yourself to learning. The ability to push through challenges while staying on course is the most important to me.
Here are some reminders for myself that help.**

  1. "It's ok to suck sometime's you just gotta embrace it, but the important thing is to not stay sucking" - C++ Teacher
  2.  Even when I feel like I learned nothing, I compare myself to how I started and how I got to this point
  3.  Heavy emphasis on breaks, whenever I feel completely stuck some time away from the task helps.  Many times I found the solution away from the task I need to complete.
