## Growth Mindset

 - To me it's just being able to accept the fact that you are capable of learning something new and know that you won't be any good at it at first but you will eventually.

### Emotional Intelligence

 I dont have my old sheet available but I feel like generally my scores are higher overall.

- Self-Awareness - 21
- Self-Management - 19
- Social Awareness - 22
- Relationship Management - 18

## Biases

Same as above, generally my scores are higher overall.

- WHAT IS BIAS - 13
- BIAS AND IDENTITY - 13
- BIAS AND THE BRAIN - 13
- CONNECT TO MITIGATE BIAS - 11
- EMPATHY AND CURIOSITY - 13
- MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS - 13
- EFFECTIVE COURAGE - 13
- FOUR WAYS TO ACT - 11

1. I had a tie for a lot of areas of strength but it's still good to improve on them, I wish to focus on Effective Courage and Meaningful Connections.

2. Four ways to act and Empathy and Curiosity were my lowest, four ways to act had two statements that I didn't really mesh well with mainly the second one.  It makes it seem like if you typically enjoy to consume content that you normally like you most likely will not expand your perspective which I don't really think it's that black and white. I actively consume content that I find interesting and anything outside of that doesn't interest me, doesn't mean I won't accept new points of view.
