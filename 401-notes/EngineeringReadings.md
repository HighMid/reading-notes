## Engineering Readings

### [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://anthony-moore.medium.com/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-6ab2302b8e8c)

- Probably never go on social media as I'll probably have random strangers @ing me about me spending money on my pity pulls on Honkai Star Rail and not donating money to stop world hunger.

### [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

- Seems like a lot of trial and error, having a framework seems to be the cheat sheet on how to achieve results.

### [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Time management is key, can't really count on how many times I think something would only take me about an hour to complete but then I see myself working on it for like three hours. Could probably start using more psuedocode as it's a very simple and easy way to understand a process and visualize it and not get too lost in the sauce.

### [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/a3mi00v/5-whys)

- Assemble the homies

    1. Why is the problem occurring and define it.
        - Get a clear idea on why the problem has come to be and write out the chain reaction the problem has caused.

    2. Ask Why four more times with each iteration answering the previous why.

### [Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)

- Mark is a god damn superhero.


1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

    - I bring flexibility in my work. I enjoy the process of learning new things and piling on the creativity of myself and others. 
    - Given if it's for a game company, I know how to make a players experience enjoyable and love feedback on things to be added to a game while also ensuring that it's implementation is viable in the current landscape. 
    - If its for Machine Learning, I have a strong interest in the methodologies and tools of ML technology. I have experience in identifying and innovating algorithms that are both efficient and scalable.

2. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

    1. Take a break and do something else whether it's talking to friends, taking a walk outside or playing video games.  It's important to take breaks as sometimes all you need is just a little separation from your tasks.

    2. Thinking like a computer also helps as well, and diving into the code in that PoV helps understand the process as well. Often times I would fill in the gaps between everything because you know that's a human thing to do, computers aren't human...yet, so you have to ensure that the process is like walking up stairs one step at a time.

    3. Realizing that sometimes it's better to just not do what you're doing. Focusing on features that don't really pay out the appropriate amount of reward vs the effort involved. Having a inspiration is amazing but also it could derail a lot of focus from the core of a project. Taking a step back and staying within scope is important.

    4. If none of those work, I find yelling at my computer to help and I am really excited for the day when my computer is able to yell at me back for forgetting to put a semicolon at the end of a line.
