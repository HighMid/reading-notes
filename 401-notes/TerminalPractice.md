## Terminal Practice

1. **The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.**

    - The command line is an interface where you can type commands directly to your computer's operating system.

    - It allows users to execute various commands to perform functions such as file manipulation, program execution, and system monitoring.

    - Varies based off of OS, on Linux is already avaiable as Terminal and on Windows as Command Prompt.

2. **Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.**

    - Linux, like other Unix-based systems, organizes files in a hierarchical directory structure. You can use cd to change directories, and ls to list the contents of a directory.

3. **More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.**

    - In Linux, everything is considered a file, including directories and devices. Linux files have permissions and ownership settings that determine who can read, write, or execute them.

4. **Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.**

    - Manual pages, or "man pages," provide documentation for commands and programs. Typing `man command` in the Terminal will display the manual page for that command, explaining its usage, options, and examples.

5. **File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.**

    - Creating Files and Directories:
        - `touch [file]`: Creates a new file.
        - `mkdir [directory]`: Creates a new directory.
    - Deleting:
        - `rm [file]`: Removes a file.
        - `rmdir [directory]`: Removes an empty directory.
    - Renaming and Moving:
        - `mv [source] [destination]`: Moves or renames files and directories.
    - Copying:
        - `cp [source] [destination]`: Copies files and directories.
