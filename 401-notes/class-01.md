## Class 01 Notes

1. **In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.**

    - Just starting is always the hardest part, atleast for me.  Sticking with something is easier than starting for me and it's how I felt when I started Python about a year ago. Taking breaks is something I always emphasize when I'm learning, I always find myself more clear of mind after I take some time away from tasks. Having a routine is also something I found to be really helpful during learning for me. Setting time to do something helps me maintain focus on the task and makes me more productive.

2. **After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

    - Time complexity is the amount of time it takes to complete a task. Space complexity is the amount of memory used.

3. **Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.**

    - Mutable means that the value can be changed. Immutable means that the value cannot be changed.

        - Mutable: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets
        - Immutable: Integers, Floats, Tuples
